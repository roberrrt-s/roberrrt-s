### Hello

I'm Robert. I currently lecture on anything related to data, the web or development at [CMD Amsterdam](https://cmd-amsterdam.nl/), a BSc programme at the [Hogeschool van Amsterdam](https://hva.nl). I mainly use GitHub as a portfolio, so if you're visiting this page from [robertspier.nl](https://robertspier.nl): Welcome! feel free to browse around.

I do some stuff with interfaces, but mainly specialise in the management of data and / or information in large complex systems. I like to be the bridge between applications and humans, and have dedicated professionals to help me on those flanks. I can be reached at robert.spier [at] gmail. I assume most of you can deduce which address to use.

Cheers.
