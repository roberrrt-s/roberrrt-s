### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Robert. I currently lecture on anything related to data, the web or development at [https://cmd-amsterdam.nl/](CMD Amsterdam), a Bachelor at the (https://www.hva.nl/)[Hogeschool van Amsterdam]. I mainly use GitHub as a portfolio, so if you're visiting this page from [robertspier.nl](robertspier.nl): Welcome, feel free to browse around.

I do some stuff with interfaces, but mainly specialise in the management of data and / or information in large complex systems. I like to be the bridge between applications and humans, and have dedicated professionals to help me on those flanks. I can be reached at robert.spier [at] gmail. I assume most of you can deduce which address to use.

Cheers.
